Sentinel-2 land cover and land use (LCLU) mapping using unsupervised learning techniques: K-means, CLARA &amp; Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Land cover and land use mapping (LCLU) utilizes remotely sensed data to detect and monitor different surface features on Earth, including specific physical landscapes (e.g., water bodies, forests, and crops) and human-induced changes to the landscapes (e.g., agricultural, deforestation, and urbanization), without in situ or on-site observation. The remotely sensed data can be obtained via active and/or passive systems: the former relies on the emission of ‘artificial’ energy (electromagnetic waves) to the Earth’s surfaces and the phase information of the returned waves whereas the latter relies on the use of visible, near infrared and short-wave infrared sensors to form images of the surface features by measuring the surface reflectance. This project focuses on the latter system, particularly the optical Sentinel-2 remote sensing for facilitating LCLU mapping via unsupervised learning techniques, namely Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The area of interest is Carey Island, Selangor (Malaysia), which contains several LCLU classes including areas that are covered by plants, deforested areas, bare grounds or roads, urbanized areas, and water bodies. Therefore, this project aims to explore the effectiveness of two clustering algorithms (K-means and Clustering Large Applications (CLARA)), in grouping image pixels into several clusters corresponding to the LCLU classes observed on the Sentinel-2 image. The applied clustering takes advantage of nine Sentinel-2 spectral bands comprising visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared with original spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m, as well as the reduced Sentinel-2 data following the PCA (i.e., principal components) to explore the impacts of data dimensionality reduction on the quality of clustering.CLVALID package was used to compare the performance between K-means and CLARA clustering algorithms.
